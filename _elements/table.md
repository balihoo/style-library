title: Table

Tables can have a title, header buttons, and row buttons. Not all columns need to be sortable, but ones that are should show a hand pointer on hover to indicate that they can be clicked, and the primary sorted column gets an arrow indicating whether itâ€™s sorted ascending or descending.
