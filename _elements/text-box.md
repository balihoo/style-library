title: Text Box
---

Use this resizable text box when the user needs to type longer strings of free text (5+ words), or multiple lines of text. Text boxes are generally wider than text fields, wide enough to accommodate two or three rows of 60 characters. It could vary depending on the expected use of the box, but if you are unsure then 360 x 80 is probably a good default.

### Preview:

<form action="" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8">
	<textarea class="form-control" rows="3"></textarea>
</form>

### Code Sample:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Text Area -->
<textarea class="form-control" rows="3"></textarea>
{% endhighlight %}
