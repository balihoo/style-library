<div class="jumbotron">
	<h1>Platform Elements</h1>
	<p>This is a collection of all the different design elements currently used in the BAC interface. Not necessarily all the ways they are implemented, just the design controls and elements. The goal is to make this into a library that includes code so developers will be able to just grab elements from here as needed with some guidance on how best to implement, so they donâ€™t have to make it up each time.</p>
